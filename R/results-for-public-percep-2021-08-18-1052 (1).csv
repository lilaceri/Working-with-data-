With a large wild herbivore there needs to be a carnivore to control the population. If bison are “reintroduced” would wolves have to follow? Lynx? Bears? Obviously I’m no expert but there needs to be lessons learnt from current issues and maybe focus on the current issues like deer overpopulation, loss of natural habitat (not only to environmental but also human issues), rewilding, invasive species, etc before cramming in new species and projects.

","9","6-10 thousand years ago is too far in the distant past to make this a practical or desirable reintroduction.  Since that period in history, we have completely changed as a country with a vast explosion of population and community development as a result.  Bison are very large and potentially dangerous animals which need a lot of space - and we don't have a lot of spare space.  In an enclosed rewilding scheme they'd be fine, but NOT as part of our native wildlife.  They are no longer native here, and cattle (preferably old breeds) can do the job pretty much as well as bison.","I am excited at the prospect of some serious rewilding being done, but I really do not think that reintroduction of bison is a good way to go.  They died out far too long ago and I don't believe they will fit in well with the wildlife and the countryside that we have now.  Keeping them enclosed in a rewilding scheme such as Knepp would work, but is really makes them into a managed species since there will need to be culls.  Of course, this would produce some very good quality 'wild' meat - far better than factory farming.  ","We should probably be looking at smaller bovines for two reasons: one, we are a small nation with limited natural resources, and two, people are stupid and will wander into areas with bison present and will not take sufficient care.  They will feed them and make they unafraid of people and then people will get hurt/killed.","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","1",,"27","4","3","1","1","1",
